- 👋 Hi, I’m @lemooos
- 👀 I’m interested in programming full-stack applications (but I truly prefer Front-end, things moving on the screen)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang for Backend and an advanced form of using SQL with Postgres.

- 📫 How to reach me here or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-lemos-703071206/)
